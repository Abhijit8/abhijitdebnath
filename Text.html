  <p style = "font-family: Raleway" align="center" class="text"> I grew up in the northeast state of India called Assam. As a child, growing up I witnessed cultural conflicts between different communities for space and identity. During my early 20’s in order to further my education, I migrated from my hometown to Santiniketan in West Bengal to pursue my BFA and MFA (painting). While perusing the traditional techniques, mediums, and surfaces of painting such as canvas, oil, and watercolors Soon, I realized that those mediums on its own would not suffice in materializing my visual construct. Therefore, my lack of satisfaction with the traditional medium propelled me subconsciously towards experimenting with various surfaces.  As I was savoring the process of using these surfaces simultaneously visual dialogues were being created by artworks itself. However, I failed to comprehend the significance of these dialogues until I left the shelter of my institution to face the “real world”. I had moved from Shantiniketan to Chennai then to Bangalore searching for a job as a means to survive and satisfy my everyday needs. These shifts above and migration created a sense of vulnerability in my being. <br/>
    <br/>
    In my works, I have tried to explore the debate between materiality and abstract concepts. To learn the dialogue between social space and identity, and how humans are dealing with that space emotionally, socially, and politically. I use Soil to create a neutral space and using cotton Lungi, Gamcha (Bengali and Assamese local towel), cotton Bag, found objects and photography to create a dialogue between space, humans and material. The storytelling of my father to remind me of our ancestors past worked on me like a pulley going back and forth reminding me of my roots simultaneously  making me aware of the space I was born into and grew up in, in some way didn’t belong to us. Yet to juxtapose this, the entire the conflict between the two communities has always been about hoisting the flag of ownership on the land, ideological space and all the material space. <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently, we are living in a world where everybody is more conscious of identity and their social space. Because of that people are becoming concious about their community or to make sure there identity should not vanish from that physical national boundaries.  <br/>
    <br/>
    My grandfather moved to Assam from East Bengal before partition during colonial era for government job (before 1947). Therefore, my family was fortunate enough to be recognized as Indian citizens, however as I was growing up. I realized many such migrants were. Many migrants have to go through the process of NRC (National register of citizens). The NRC was setup by the Indian government specifically in the state of Assam to recognize illegal migrants. Due to this political segregation of individuals, Assam’s social atmosphere is now divided in too few communities. As I was growing up to realize though the language barrier that my family also belonged to the minority group. <br/>
    <br/>
    In many ways I have felt this rift especially when it comes to the language spoken in the state. And as I migrated myself from Assam. My need to understand this conflict for space deepened. Early 2019 I visited the border areas which is barricaded by the Indian army from where the illegal migrants come through to India. While I studying the landscape, I also met with lower economic class residents of the area. These residents are still battling the process the process of acceptance and a long ongoing NRC procedures.  These residents are living in deficiency of favorable social, political and economic conditions that is applicable to an Indian citizen.</p>
